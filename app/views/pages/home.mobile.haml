          If a designer of web applications knows enough about what he's trying to communicate, he may omit things that he knows and the user will have a feeling of those things as strongly as though the designer has put them on the page. The dignity of movement of the iceberg is due to only one-eighth of it being above water.

          UXme. is a web development and user experience design boutique. We
          specialize in Ruby-on-Rails development of beautiful, powerful web
          applications. We care about only one thing: your user. Every decision we
          make is centered around your users, your customers.
        %p
          Our development philosophy is simple, what you leave off the page is as
          important as what you leave on. If Ernest Hemingway were a web
          developer, he'd work for us.
        %p.whitespace
          We love whitespace.
        #pullquote

            %p
              We love simple, bold and ultra-minimal.
        %p.whitespace
          We use color only when there is a good reason to do so.

          UXme. web applications are about speed, elegance and simplicity. If you
          want your site to look like Yahoo.com, don't contact us. If you want your
          site to have to simple elegance of the Google home page, then we should
          talk. If you need help turning your great idea into something beautiful,
          then we'd love to help.

          UXme. was founded by Brian Dear, a New York City UX and Ruby-on-Rails
          consultant. He is the cofounder of #{link_to "iCouch.me", "http://icouch.me"}

          Process
        %p
          With the proliferation of do-it-yourself website building tools, creating
          a web application is easier than ever. However, creating an effective,
          beautiful and elegant web application takes experience in not only design
          and programming, it also requires business experience. While it's not
          particularly hard to copy designs of successful websites, those websites
          are not
          %strong
            your
          business.
        %p
          Every business has something special to offer their customers and every
          business website should have only one goal: to convince visitors to take
          action. That action could be buying your product, asking for a quote,
          or visiting your store. Every decision in crafting your web application
          should always be focused on achieving that one goal.
        %p
          UXme. is Agile. We collaborate with you. Of course, you're the client
          and you're paying the bills, but creating an incredible web application
          is a team effort. We consider you an active partner and participant in
          all stages of the process.

          Discovery
        %p
          Discovery is fun. This is where the sky is the limit and budgets
          don't matter. We work with you to understand your business, your goals
          and your personality.
        %p
          This is when you can use your imagination. Perhaps we'll sketch on napkins,
          share photos and other websites that best communicate the look you want.
          During Discovery, we provide guidance, inspiration and experience to help
          you articulate your ideas.

          Story Carding
        %p
          Story Carding is where we act like a user. We decide on what a user should
          do on your site, from when they first visit your landing page until they
          tell their friends how great your product is.
        %p
          We'll build wireframes that allow you to see your site before it's actually
          built. Wireframes are like precision sketches that help you and us
          visualize the major elements and interactions of your site. This is an
          important step because it allows us to test ideas without the time expense
          of writing code or doing highly-detailed photoshop mockups.

          Design
        %p
          After we complete the wireframes for your site, we're ready to start
          choosing the typography, graphics and other elements for your site. Design
          is far more than just making your site look pretty. Great design is
          fundamental to making your users love your site (and buy what you're
          selling!)
        %p
          All design has one purpose: to enhance the user experience.

          Coding
        %p
          Coding is where the rubber meets the road. We turn the design elements
          and the wireframes into a fully functional site.
        %p
          You'll be our partner through the process. You'll interact with the site
          as it's being built. We set up a "staging" server that allows you to use
          your web application and provide very important feedback throughout the
          process. You'll be in regular communication with us on all aspects of
          the coding process.

          Rinse & Repeat
        %p
          After we create a working prototype of your site, the work isn't done!
          We'll launch your site and then observe how users interact with your
          web application. This is where we'll make refinements, fix any errors and
          improve upon things. We might add new features, take some out or redesign
          elements.
        %p
          For as long as you'd like us involved with your project, we're your
          technical and business consultants. Our goal is to create a web application
          that will serve your business for years to come.
